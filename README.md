## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned some new CSS tricks such as inserting an SVG as a background image in an input box and also using background positioning, also used both grid and flexbox where I felt appropriate.

Adopted a mobile first approach and added a media query for screen sizes larger than 700px, using Flexbox to move from a column to a row based display.

I found the Javascript aspect relatively straightforward, however I feel my code could be much more 'DRY' as I ended up with a series of event listeners and also two 'calculate bill' functions based on the fixed % tabs and then the custom tip amount.

I'll be interested to see how other people approached this aspect.

### Continued development

This was good practice for using both Grid and Flexbox and I will continue to work on using this CSS functionality as much as possible in my layouts.

Also I'm intending to revisit this project in the future and try to make my code more elegant and streamlined! Feel it is somewhat repetitive in parts as noted above.
